## What is this?

Human-in-the-loop (HITL) lets an agent pause mid-run to collect input,
confirmation, or a choice from the user, then resume with that answer
folded back into its reasoning. It's what turns an autonomous workflow
into a collaborative one: the agent keeps its context, the user keeps
the steering wheel.

## When should I use this?

Use HITL when you need:

- **Quality control** — a human gate at high-stakes decision points
- **Edge cases** — graceful fallbacks when the agent's confidence is low
- **Expert input** — lean on the user for domain knowledge the model lacks
- **Reliability** — a more robust loop for real-world, production traffic

## Two patterns for HITL in CopilotKit

<Steps>
  <Step>
    ### Pause a tool with Strands' native interrupt

    AWS Strands ships a first-class
    [interrupt primitive](https://strandsagents.com/docs/user-guide/concepts/interrupts/).
    A tool's callback receives a context whose `interrupt({ name, reason })`
    call halts the agent loop and hands `reason` to the client as the interrupt
    payload. The AG-UI adapter finishes the run with `RUN_FINISHED` carrying
    `outcome.type === "interrupt"`.

    
~~~~typescript title="src/agent/interrupt-agent.ts"
export const scheduleMeeting = tool({
  name: "schedule_meeting",
  description:
    "Ask the user to pick a meeting time, then confirm what was scheduled.",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    topic: z.string().describe("Short description of the meeting purpose."),
    attendee: z.string().optional().describe("Who the meeting is with."),
  }),
  callback: ({ topic, attendee }, context) => {
    // Typed optional by the SDK, so this is checked rather than asserted: with
    // no context there is nothing to pause on, and pretending otherwise would
    // schedule a meeting the user never saw.
    if (!context) {
      throw new Error("schedule_meeting needs a tool context to pause on");
    }

    // `attendee` is optional and the reason has to be JSON, which has no
    // `undefined`, so it is omitted rather than sent as undefined.
    const answer = context.interrupt<ResumeEnvelope>({
      name: "schedule_meeting",
      reason: attendee === undefined ? { topic } : { topic, attendee },
    });

    // Three cancel shapes reach here: each bridge's own sentinel for a
    // cancelled resume entry, and the picker's Cancel button, which resolves
    // with a `cancelled` flag inside the payload.
    const { choice, cancelled } = readResume(answer);
    if (cancelled) {
      return `User cancelled. Meeting NOT scheduled: ${topic}`;
    }

    const label = choice.chosen_label || choice.chosen_time;
    return label
      ? `Meeting scheduled for ${label}: ${topic}`
      : `User did not pick a time. Meeting NOT scheduled: ${topic}`;
  },
});
~~~~


    How the answer reaches the tool depends on the adapter version. The pinned
    `@ag-ui/aws-strands` 0.2.3 hands the client's payload through untouched and
    signals a cancel as `{ status: "cancelled" }`; the Python adapter wraps an
    answer as `{ response: ... }` and cancels with `{ cancelled: true }`. Read
    both shapes, or a picked slot comes back to the model as though the user
    never picked one.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Keep the pausing tool off a client-executed name

    `useHumanInTheLoop` registers its tool on the FRONTEND, so a name used
    there cannot also be a pausing backend tool. This showcase mounts a
    dedicated interrupt agent and points the interrupt demos' agent names at
    it, leaving `schedule_meeting` on the shared agent free for the
    frontend-tool flow.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    ### Resume in the same process, or across a restart

    Pause and resume on the same running process need no extra wiring. For a
    resume that survives a restart, give the agent a Strands `SessionManager`
    through `StrandsAgentConfig.sessionManagerProvider`; the adapter persists
    its interrupt checkpoint into that session.

  </Step>
</Steps>

CopilotKit ships two complementary ways to pause an agent turn and ask
the human something. They look similar from the outside (the chat
pauses, a custom component appears, the user answers, the run resumes)
but they're wired differently on the backend, and each has its own niche.

| Pattern | Who decides to pause? | Backend surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useHumanInTheLoop` | The **LLM**, by calling a registered client-side tool | A frontend-only tool description (Zod schema + `render`) |
| `useInterrupt` | The **graph**, by calling `interrupt(...)` during a node | A server-side `interrupt()` call in your LangGraph agent |

**Pick `useHumanInTheLoop`** when the pause is an _agent-initiated_
decision — the model chose to ask the user — and you want the picker UI
inlined into the normal tool-call flow.

**Pick `useInterrupt`** when the pause is a _graph-enforced_ checkpoint —
the code path deterministically requires a human answer — and you want
`langgraph.interrupt()` as the server-side contract.

## Pattern 1 — `useHumanInTheLoop` (tool-based)

The agent registers a HITL tool on the client with `useHumanInTheLoop`.
When the LLM calls that tool, CopilotKit routes the call through your
`render` function, which shows a custom component and calls `respond`
with the user's answer. The agent sees the answer as the tool result and
continues from there.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/hitl-in-chat/page.tsx
import React from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotChat,
  useHumanInTheLoop,
  useConfigureSuggestions,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import type { TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";
import { TimePickerCard } from "./time-picker-card";

const DEFAULT_SLOTS: TimeSlot[] = [
  { label: "Tomorrow 10:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-19T10:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Tomorrow 2:00 PM", iso: "2026-04-19T14:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 9:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-21T09:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 3:30 PM", iso: "2026-04-21T15:30:00-07:00" },
];

export default function HitlInChatDemo() {
  return (
    <CopilotKit runtimeUrl="/api/copilotkit" agent="hitl-in-chat">
      <div className="flex justify-center items-center h-screen w-full">
        <div className="h-full w-full max-w-4xl">
          <Chat />
        </div>
      </div>
    </CopilotKit>
  );
}

function Chat() {
  useConfigureSuggestions({
    suggestions: [
      {
        title: "Book a call with sales",
        message:
          "Please book an intro call with the sales team to discuss pricing.",
      },
      {
        title: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice",
        message: "Schedule a 1:1 with Alice next week to review Q2 goals.",
      },
    ],
    available: "always",
  });

  useHumanInTheLoop({
    agentId: "hitl-in-chat",
    name: "book_call",
    description:
      "Use this tool for ANY request to schedule, book, set up, arrange, or organize a call, meeting, 1:1, intro, sync, or chat — including phrasings like 'schedule a 1:1 with Alice', 'book a call', or 'set up a meeting'. It presents the user an in-chat time picker with candidate slots and returns their chosen time. ALWAYS prefer this tool over `schedule_meeting` or any other scheduling tool when the user wants to pick a meeting time in this conversation.",
    parameters: z.object({
      topic: z
        .string()
        .describe("What the call is about (e.g. 'Intro with sales')"),
      attendee: z
        .string()
        .describe("Who the call is with (e.g. 'Alice from Sales')"),
    }),
    render: ({ args, status, respond }: any) => (
      <TimePickerCard
        topic={args?.topic ?? "a call"}
        attendee={args?.attendee}
        slots={DEFAULT_SLOTS}
        status={status}
        onSubmit={(result) => respond?.(result)}
      />
    ),
  });
```

The picker UI is fed a static list of candidate slots — this is just
data the demo page owns, so you can swap in real availability, a
calendar API, or anything else:

```typescript
// src/app/demos/hitl-in-chat/page.tsx
import React from "react";
import {
  CopilotKit,
  CopilotChat,
  useHumanInTheLoop,
  useConfigureSuggestions,
} from "@copilotkit/react-core/v2";
import { z } from "zod";
import type { TimeSlot } from "./time-picker-card";
import { TimePickerCard } from "./time-picker-card";

const DEFAULT_SLOTS: TimeSlot[] = [
  { label: "Tomorrow 10:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-19T10:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Tomorrow 2:00 PM", iso: "2026-04-19T14:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 9:00 AM", iso: "2026-04-21T09:00:00-07:00" },
  { label: "Monday 3:30 PM", iso: "2026-04-21T15:30:00-07:00" },
];
```

## Pattern 2 — `useInterrupt` (graph-paused)

With LangGraph's `interrupt()` the pause is enforced by the graph
itself: a node calls `interrupt({...})`, the run suspends, the client
receives the payload, renders a UI, and resumes the run with the user's
answer. CopilotKit's `useInterrupt` hook is the render contract.

See the [`useInterrupt` deep dive](/strands-typescript/human-in-the-loop/useInterrupt) for
the full walkthrough, including the backend tool and render-prop wiring.

## Going headless

Both patterns above ship with a `render` prop — CopilotKit handles the
"when to show the picker" logic for you. If you want to drive
interrupt resolution from a custom UI that lives anywhere in the tree
(not necessarily inside a chat), see the
[headless interrupts guide](/strands-typescript/human-in-the-loop/headless) — it shows
how to compose `useAgent`, `agent.subscribe`, and `copilotkit.runAgent`
to build your own `useInterrupt` equivalent.
