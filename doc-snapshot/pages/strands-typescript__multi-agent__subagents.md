# Sub-Agents

> Decompose work across multiple specialized agents with a visible delegation log.


<!-- interactive demo: subagents -->


## What is this?

Sub-agents are the canonical multi-agent pattern: a top-level
**supervisor** LLM orchestrates one or more specialized **sub-agents**
by exposing each of them as a tool. The supervisor decides what to
delegate, the sub-agents do their narrow job, and their results flow
back up to the supervisor's next step.

This is fundamentally the same shape as tool-calling, but each "tool"
is itself a full-blown agent with its own system prompt and (often) its
own tools, memory, and model.

## When should I use this?

Reach for sub-agents when a task has distinct specialized sub-tasks
that each benefit from their own focus:

- **Research → Write → Critique** pipelines, where each stage needs a
  different system prompt and temperature.
- **Router + specialists**, where one agent classifies the request and
  dispatches to the right expert.
- **Divide-and-conquer** — any problem that fits cleanly into parallel
  or sequential sub-problems.

The example below uses the Research → Write → Critique shape as the
canonical example.

## Setting up sub-agents

<!-- setup skipped: subagents-setup is not bundled for strands-typescript -->

Each sub-agent is an isolated agent call with its own model, system
prompt, and optional tools. They don't share memory or tools with the
supervisor; the supervisor only ever sees what the sub-agent returns.

<!-- snippet skipped: region 'subagent-setup' missing in strands-typescript::subagents -->

Keep sub-agent system prompts narrow and focused. The point of this pattern
is that each one does one thing well. If a sub-agent needs to know
the whole user context to do its job, that's a signal the boundary is
wrong.

## Exposing sub-agents as tools

The supervisor delegates by calling tools. Each delegation tool is a thin
wrapper around a specialized agent call that:

1. Runs the sub-agent on the supplied `task` string.
2. Records the delegation into a `delegations` slot in shared agent
   state (so the UI can render a live log).
3. Returns the sub-agent's final message as the tool result, which the
   supervisor sees on its next turn.

<!-- snippet skipped: region 'supervisor-delegation-tools' missing in strands-typescript::subagents -->

This is where CopilotKit's shared-state channel earns its keep: the
supervisor's tool calls mutate `delegations` as they happen, and the
frontend renders every new entry live.

## Rendering a live delegation log

On the frontend, the delegation log is a reactive render of the
`delegations` slot.


Subscribe with `useAgent({ updates:
[UseAgentUpdate.OnStateChanged, UseAgentUpdate.OnRunStatusChanged] })`,
read `agent.state.delegations`, and render one card per entry.

```typescript
// src/app/demos/subagents/delegation-log.tsx
/**
 * Live delegation log — renders the `delegations` slot of agent state.
 *
 * Each entry corresponds to one invocation of a sub-agent. The list
 * grows in real time as the supervisor fans work out to its children.
 * The parent header shows how many sub-agents have been called and
 * whether the supervisor is still running.
 */
// Fixed list of the three sub-agent roles the supervisor can call.
// Rendered as always-visible indicator chips at the top of the log
// (regardless of whether the supervisor has delegated yet) so the user
// — and the e2e suite — can see at a glance which sub-agents exist and
// which are currently active.
const INDICATOR_ROLES: ReadonlyArray<{
  role: "researcher" | "writer" | "critic";
  subAgent: SubAgentName;
}> = [
  { role: "researcher", subAgent: "research_agent" },
  { role: "writer", subAgent: "writing_agent" },
  { role: "critic", subAgent: "critique_agent" },
];

  const calledRoles = new Set<SubAgentName>(
    delegations.map((d) => d.sub_agent),

The result: as the supervisor fans work out to its sub-agents, the log
grows in real time, giving the user visibility into a process that
would otherwise be a long opaque spinner.
