          A checkpoint in front of anything that writes. The agent does not
          perform the side effect itself — it calls{" "}
          <code>approve_governed_action</code> with an envelope describing what
          it wants to do, and the run suspends on that call until a person
          answers. The envelope carries a <code>verdict</code> decided
          upstream, so the UI is rendering a policy decision rather than making
          one: two of the three verdicts resolve without ever showing a button.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          The page offers two ways to reach that checkpoint. This route
          implements the tool-call one. The other,{" "}
          <code>useInterrupt</code>, needs a backend that raises an AG-UI
          interrupt mid-run; nothing on the Strands TypeScript side does, and
          this page publishes no backend that would — so it is left out rather
          than mocked. The same split is already noted on{" "}
          <code>/human-in-the-loop</code>.

        <Callout tone="warn" title="The approval works; the governance is a prop">
          <p>
            The mechanism is genuine. The tool registers, the model calls it,
            the run suspends, the card draws, and <code>respond()</code>{" "}
            resumes the turn with the decision attached. That half is testable
            and it passes.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-2">
            The <code>GovernedAction</code> it is gating is not. Nothing in the
            Strands TypeScript tree publishes a policy engine, a tool that
            emits one of these envelopes, or the{" "}
            <code>executeSideEffect</code> that the page&apos;s own server
            sample calls. So <code>verdict</code>, <code>reference</code> and{" "}
            <code>id</code> arrive as whatever the model decided to put in the
            tool call — which means the card can cheerfully render{" "}
            <em>Allowed by policy</em> on the strength of an LLM&apos;s
            say-so. Treat this route as proof the approval surface works, not
            as a governed action.
          </p>

          <p>
            Worth recording because it looks like a bug and is not. The enum is
            nowhere in the export list that{" "}
            <code>@copilotkit/react-core/v2</code> spells out, so grepping the
            bundle for it finds nothing — but{" "}
            <code>dist/v2/index.mjs</code> carries{" "}
            <code>export * from &quot;@copilotkit/core&quot;</code> and the
            enum rides in on that, in the types and at runtime alike. Its
            values are <code>inProgress</code>, <code>executing</code> and{" "}
            <code>complete</code>, which is why the repo&apos;s other approval
            route can compare the bare string{" "}
            <code>&quot;executing&quot;</code> and behave identically.

          <code>GovernedAction</code> or decides its <code>verdict</code>. The
          agent behind this route is therefore the Quickstart agent under a new
          id, with no governed tool of its own; inventing one would be
