/**
 * `GovernedAction` and `GovernedActionCard`, copied from the doc page.
 *
 * Both are published — the type under "Action envelope", the component at the
 * bottom of the "Inline approval with `useInterrupt`" block. They live in this
 * file rather than beside the hook because the page's *second* pattern, the
 * `useHumanInTheLoop` one this route implements, renders `GovernedActionCard`
 * without redefining it. Only the `useInterrupt` block defines it, and that
 * block is not implemented here (no Strands backend raises an AG-UI
 * interrupt), so the card had to be lifted out on its own.
 *
 * Two things about it that matter when you look at the rendered route:
 *
 *  - `text-muted-foreground` and `bg-muted` are shadcn/ui theme tokens. This
 *    repo runs Tailwind v4 with no such tokens defined, so those two classes
 *    resolve to nothing and the card renders unstyled in those spots. Left as
 *    published.
 *
 *  - `onBlock` is only ever reached from the `useInterrupt` path, which calls
 *    `cancel()`. Under `useHumanInTheLoop` the page wires it to the same
 *    `respond({ approved: false })` as `onReject`, so on this route the two
 *    are indistinguishable.
