/**
 * The page's "Tool-call approval with `useHumanInTheLoop`" block, reproduced.
 *
 * `governedActionSchema` and the whole `GovernedActionTool` function below are
 * the doc's, verbatim — down to the trailing `[]` deps argument.
 *
 * The import resolves, despite `ToolCallStatus` being absent from the export
 * list `@copilotkit/react-core/v2` spells out: `dist/v2/index.mjs` carries
 * `export * from "@copilotkit/core"`, and the enum rides in on that. Worth
 * knowing because grepping the bundle for the symbol finds nothing and looks
 * like a missing export. It is `{ InProgress: "inProgress", Executing:
 * "executing", Complete: "complete" }` — the same three strings the repo's
 * other approval route compares against as literals.
 *
 * Everything the harness added is below `GovernedActionTool`: the suggestions,
 * the `<CopilotChat>`, and the `agentId`. The published block ends at the
 * hook's `return null` with no chat surface of its own.
 *
 * What is NOT real here is the governance. `verdict`, `reference` and `id`
 * arrive as whatever the model puts in the tool call, because no page
 * publishes a policy engine, a tool that emits a `GovernedAction`, or the
 * `executeSideEffect` its own server sample calls. The approval mechanism is
 * genuine; the decision it is gating is invented by the LLM.
 *
 * `GovernedActionCard` is the doc's too — see `../governed-action-card.tsx`
 * for why it is not in this file.
 *
 * Doc: https://docs.copilotkit.ai/strands-typescript/human-in-the-loop/governed-actions
