          The page replaces the assistant message slot with a renderer that
          feeds the streaming reply to Hashbrown&apos;s partial-JSON parser
          and renders each finished node through a component catalog. The
          code the page leaves out has been written in, but its hook calls
          are kept exactly as published. The demo has two tabs:{" "}
          <strong>as published</strong> shows what happens when you follow
          the page, and <strong>fixed</strong> is a working version.

        <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          The working version keeps the page&apos;s components and suggestions
          and changes the following:
        </p>
        <ol className="mt-2 list-decimal space-y-1 pl-5 text-sm text-slate-700 dark:text-slate-300">
          <li>
            Each component is wrapped with{" "}
            <code>exposeComponent(component, {"{ name, description, props }"})</code>
            , with props described by Hashbrown&apos;s <code>s.*</code>{" "}
            builders, and <code>useUiKit</code> gets{" "}
            <code>{"{ components }"}</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code>Stack</code> is exposed with <code>children: &quot;any&quot;</code>
            . The page&apos;s example uses it, and Hashbrown throws{" "}
            <code>Unknown element type</code> for any name it wasn&apos;t
            given.
          </li>
          <li>
            The parser is called as{" "}
            <code>useJsonParser(content, kit.schema)</code>, with the
            kit&apos;s own schema.
          </li>
          <li>
            The result is drawn with <code>kit.render(value)</code>, guarded
            for the moments mid-stream when there is no <code>ui</code> yet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prose and code fences are stripped before parsing, because
            Hashbrown&apos;s parser expects JSON from the first character.
          </li>
          <li>
            Like the page, it replaces the whole <code>assistantMessage</code>,
            with no markdown renderer involved. It reads{" "}
            <code>props.message.content</code>, falls back to the default
            message for replies with no JSON, and is passed with an{" "}
            <code>as unknown as typeof CopilotChatAssistantMessage</code> cast,
            because CopilotKit 1.74&apos;s slot type rejects a plain component.
            A dashboard reply has no copy, thumbs or regenerate toolbar.
          </li>
          <li>
            It calls <code>useConfigureSuggestions</code> inside{" "}
            <code>&lt;CopilotKit&gt;</code>, as on the JSON Render route.
          </li>
          <li>
            The agent is asked for Hashbrown&apos;s JSON shape, not the
            page&apos;s (see the next panel).

                Nothing renders: check in the Inspector that the reply starts

                did not match the UI kit means the model broke the schema, for
                example by using a component name that isn&apos;t exposed.

          The page tells the agent to emit elements as{" "}
          <code>{"{ \"type\": …, …props }"}</code>. Hashbrown&apos;s UI kit
          parses a <code>{"{ \"ui\": [ … ] }"}</code> envelope, where each
          element is keyed by its component name and its props sit under{" "}
          <code>props</code>. Given the page&apos;s shape, the fixed renderer
          draws nothing. That was checked by rendering both shapes through the
          kit on the server. The agent here is prompted for the envelope
          instead. The published factory&apos;s own description (&quot;UI-kit
          envelope generator&quot;) points the same way.
