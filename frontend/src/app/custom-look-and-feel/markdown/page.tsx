          Assistant text is drawn by one slot,{" "}
          <code>messageView.assistantMessage.markdownRenderer</code>, and by
          default Streamdown fills it. The slot takes the same three shapes as
          every other slot, and each one does something different here. An
          object is passed through to Streamdown, so its <code>components</code>{" "}
          map swaps the element for a single tag. A string adds classes to the
          markdown container. A component takes over rendering completely and
          receives the raw markdown as <code>content</code>. The demo has one tab
          for each.
