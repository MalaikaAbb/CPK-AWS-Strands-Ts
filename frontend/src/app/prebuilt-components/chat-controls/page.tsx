          Two unrelated controls that share a page: opening and closing a
          prebuilt chat from your own UI, and capturing thumbs-up / thumbs-down
          on assistant messages. The first goes through{" "}
          <code>useCopilotChatConfiguration()</code>, whose{" "}
          <code>setModalOpen</code> only exists when something in the tree owns
          modal state — the prebuilt Popup and Sidebar create it, a bare{" "}
          <code>&lt;CopilotChat&gt;</code> does not. The second is a pair of
          handlers on the <code>messageView.assistantMessage</code> slot; the
          buttons render only when a handler is present.

            <code>analytics</code> is not a global, not imported, and not
            explained. This route records into local React state instead so the

            provided:&quot;</em> appears twice in a row. Cosmetic, but it is in
            the published source.
